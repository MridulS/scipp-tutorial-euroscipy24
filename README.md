# Multi-dimensional arrays with Scipp

This tutorial provides a [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/) environment and if you already have pixi installed you can clone the repo and get started.
```
git clone ...
pixi run jupyter lab
```

If you prefer using a conda/mamba/pip environment you can get a local environment setup with:
```
git clone ...
```

More in-depth tutorials are available in the [Scipp user guide](https://scipp.github.io/user-guide/index.html).
